## Welcome to Lives and Voices

The Lives and Voices of People in Extraordinary Circumstances

In an accelerating tidal wave of human affairs, Lives and Voices is the must-read source to understand how major events affect peopleâ€™s lives half the world away. 

Lives and Voices brings on the ground reactions to world events, as an airstrike, explores everyday life in conflict, and gives voice to people who don't have a voice. 

Through the best photography and stories from the ground, Lives and Voices helps understand everyday life in interesting, difficult and often dangerous places, which are affected by the dramatic or seemingly benign actions and decisions our leaders take. 

Lives and Voices began as a humanitarian, photography and reporting project in 2014. The initial mission was to volunteer in a Syrian refugee camp in Iraq. I began to interview people I met in addition to photographing them.
